#(a) Copy two text files with size greater than 1 block (e.g., fuseLib.c and myFS.h) into the
#FS as well as into a temp directory (./temp for instance) in the Linuxâ€™s file system.

	# Copy file 1 into FileSystem and TMP
	cp $SRC/$FILE1 $TMP/$FILE1	 		# Copy into temporary directory
	cp $SRC/$FILE1 $MPOINT/$FILE1			# Copy into filesystem mount directory
	
	# Copy file 2 into FileSystem and TMP
	cp $SRC/$FILE2 $TMP/$FILE2			# Copy into temporary directory
	cp $SRC/$FILE2 $MPOINT/$FILE2			# Copy into filesystem mount directory

#(b) Check the integrity of the virtual disk with my-fsck and perform a diff between the
#original files and those copied to the FS. Truncate the first file (man truncate) in the
#temp folder and in your FS so as to reduce the file size in one block.
